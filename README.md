This repository is for the Module 3 Challenge 

This exercise involved the use of functions and methods in Python.  It's purpose is to obtain input as: a savings balance, interest rate, and term in months and calculate the earned interest for a savings account.  Same thing is done for a CD, only a different function is called for its interest calculation. 
Following the calculation in both cases (savings and CD), the main function driving everything is to print the earned interest, and the new balance with the interest added at the end of the term.  

For me, the most effort spent was ensuring the data was entered correctly.  Everthing else was fairly straight forward.  I assumed simple interest was to be calculated.  Nothing was mentioned regarding a requirement for compounded interest. 
With that said, I used the following links for some of my editing effort on the data.  Relying on correct user input, ran the risk of program failure or unexpected results...
